## Experience

- [Ask Delphi](https://delphi.allenai.org)
   - Delphi is a research prototype designed to model people’s moral judgments on a variety of everyday situations. This demo shows the abilities and limitations of state-of-the-art models today.

   - Several cool demos from the NVIDIA research team


## Warming Up

- Use your TU Delft credentials to log-in and access [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOPzwy3E=/). The board is password protected. You can find the password on Brightspace. 
- Think about one or more Product, Service, or System that, in your opinion, is powered by Artificial Intelligence technology.
- Feel free to take inspirations from the world around you. Take pictures from your neighborhood, your home, the faculty...
- Create a copy the Template Frame in the Miro board. Past an image of the IPSS, describe it, and explain the role(s) that AI has in the working of that product, service, or system.
