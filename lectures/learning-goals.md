# Learning Goals

Welcome to the multimedia processing module. This handout contains information for the image process tutorial, individual assignment, and group assignment. This module has the following learning goals:  

 - **Goal 1**: Understand how image processing can be applied to inform the design of product-service systems or to be integrated into such systems (i.e., what can we do using image processing techniques?)
 - **Goal 2**: Be able to critically reflect on model capability by understanding how the input image quality and conditions can affect model performance (i.e., why image processing techniques work or do not work as expected?)
 - **Goal 3**: Understand how to automate the image processing pipeline using Python, document how the code works, and have good code quality
