# Tutorial 3: Creating Machine Learning Models with Structured Data
Welcome to the structured data module. This handout contains information for the preparation, tutorial, individual assignment, and group assignment.   

## Learning Goals

This module has the following learning goals:

 - **Goal 1**: Understand how to design experiments using machine learning pipelines to help stakeholders make sense of structured data from product-service systems
 - **Goal 2**: Be able to conduct experiments to critically reflect and understand how features and evaluation metrics affect the performance of machine learning models
 - **Goal 3**: Understand how to automate the machine learning pipeline of structured data to conduct experiments for different settings, document how the code works, and have good code quality

 <p style="color:red"> Before attending the tutorial, complete the tasks listed in the <em>Preparation</em> section. We will discuss your results & reflections at the beginning of the tutorial session.  </p>
