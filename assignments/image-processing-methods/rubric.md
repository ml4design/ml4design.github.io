# Grading Rubric (Group Assignment)

**Assessment of Learning Goal 1: Quality of describing how image processing can be used in the design process (weight 40%)**
- Excellent (9-10)
  - Take a set of photos that have very diverse conditions (e.g., weather, lighting, location, angle, scale, etc.)
  - Summarize the model output into convincing findings that can inform the design of the product-service system
- Good (7-8)
  - Take a set of photos that have reasonably diverse conditions (e.g., weather, lighting, location, angle, scale, etc.)
  - Summarize the model output into findings that can provide some useful insights in the design process
- Sufficient (6)
  - Take a set of photos that may not have diverse conditions (e.g., weather, lighting, location, angle, scale, etc.)
  - Have some summarization of the findings from the model output, but some parts may not be convincing or not elaborated properly
- Insufficient (<6)
  - No photos or only a few photos are taken with poor diversity
  - Have no summarization of the findings from the model output, or the summarization has poor quality

**Assessment of Learning Goal 2: Quality of the critical reflection of model capability (weight 40%)**
- Excellent (9-10)
  - Use rich examples with different variety to reflect on model capability in a great detail
  - Have convincing insights about how to create a good dataset for training models 
- Good (7-8)
  - Use proper examples to reflect on model capability in a reasonable way
  - Have proper insights about how to create a good dataset for training models
- Sufficient (6)
  - Use some examples to reflect on model capability, but the reflection may have flaws
  - Have some insights about how to create datasets for training models, but some insights may not be convincing
- Insufficient (<6)
  - No examples or no reflections on model capability, or the reflections have poor quality
  - Have no insights about dataset creation, or the insights have poor quality

**Assessment of Learning Goal 3: Ability to automate the image processing pipeline (weight 20%)**
- Excellent (9-10)
  - Fully automate the image processing pipeline
  - Have good documentation about how the code works
  - Have very good code quality
- Good (7-8)
  - Fully automate the image processing pipeline
  - Have reasonable documentation about how the code works
  - Most of the code is human-readable
- Sufficient (6)
  - Some image processing pipeline is automated but some parts require human effort
  - Have some documentation about how the code works, but some may not be clear
  - Some part of the code is hard to understand
- Insufficient (<6)
  - The image processing pipeline is not automated and requires all human effort to drag and drop the images into the web interface to get the results
