# Individual Assignment

In the individual assignment, you need to edit the Python script to make it work for counting the number of bikes in an image, as this will prepare you for the group assignment.

We have provided a **count_objects** function in the script to help you count bikes. The usage of the function is documented inside the function in the script. **Your first task is to use the function and edit the code to count bikes in images.**

After that, **your next task is to explore the object detection model** using all the bike images that we provided in the “data/bike” folder. You should already have downloaded the images. In this task, feel free to use the script or the web interface, as shown below:

 - Link to the object detection model: [https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50](https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50)

Specifically, use the knowledge and method that you learned in the preparation and the tutorial to reflect on the model capability. Is the model detecting bikes correctly? If not, under what conditions does the model fail? And what are the possible reasons that lead to such failure? Write down your findings and thoughts. Then, discuss your findings and thoughts with your group members.
