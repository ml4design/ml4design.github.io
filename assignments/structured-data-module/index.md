# Creating Machine Learning Models with Structured Data

## Learning Goals

Welcome to the structured data module. This handout contains information for the preparation, tutorial, individual assignment, and group assignment. This module has the following learning goals:

 - **Goal 1**: Understand how to design experiments using machine learning pipelines to help stakeholders make sense of structured data 
 - **Goal 2**: Be able to conduct experiments to critically reflect and understand how features and evaluation metrics affect the performance of machine learning models
 - **Goal 3**: Understand how to automate the machine learning pipeline of structured data to conduct experiments for different settings, document how the code works, and have good code quality
